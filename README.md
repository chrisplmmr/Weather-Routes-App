# Weather Routes

### A webapp that allows the user to type a driving route, and see weather updates and radar along the path of that driving route embedded into the map. 
### (This was a project for university, but I am now planning an improved version using better code convention and organization practices, as well as creating a better front end for the website)
#### Requires node installed locally into project directory.
